This is the repository I use to synchronize data (e.g., dotfiles, passwords) accross multiple computers.

I make no guarantees about anything in this repository. Use at your own risk.

# Set Up

Before doing anything else, run the git_config script from the root directory.
This properly sets up the three remotes and local configuration.
